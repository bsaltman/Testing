# Testing
Learning **GitHub**.

### This repository was created in order to practice with github
  * The website featured in this repository was chosen for nostalgic purposes and should not be considered a representation of my skills related to web design.
  * The content was written during the first week, of my first computer science course and should not be considered a representation of my knowledge related to web material.
  * These qualifiers don't matter and I only wrote them to practice my markdown.
